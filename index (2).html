<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Molly had been starting out of her window for about and hour now.On her desk,lying between the copies of <i>Nature,New scientist,</i> and all other scientific
journals her work had appeared in,was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>.It had been Molly's favourite book since college,and the longer she spent in
these four walls the more she left needed to be free.</p>
<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under the poster with an Oscar Wild quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing 
better to do</q>.Although many considered her pioneering work,unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucliec Acid">DNA</abbr>,to be an outstanding 
achievement ,Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
